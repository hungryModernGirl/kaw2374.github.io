				I currently work at <a href="https://optaros.com">Optaros</a>, an eCommerce solutions provider, as a developer delivering and supporting projects for our clients. This position is fast paced and demanding, which has challenged me to grow by learning new languages, frameworks, tools, and techniques to solve problems. In this role, I'm client facing and repsonsible for the development and maintenance of several projects simultaneously.</br>
				</br>
				I had an internship at <a href="https://uShip.com">uShip</a>, which was immensely engaging and a great introduction to the tech field. I was on a team that was tasked with transitioning the site to a responsive design. We acheived this by working closely together using the Agile methodology. Being a young startup, uShip was crazy fun and was very unique experience.</br>
				</br>
				I earned my degree in Computer Sciences at the <a href="https://utexas.edu">University of Texas at Austin</a>, May 2013.

				When I'm not at work, or working on work, or thinking about doing work, I am the lead singer in a band, <a href="ocelotalot.com">Ocelot a lot</a>. I like to think we are pretty cool 8) </br>
				</br>
				I also am part of a DnD campaign, where I play a Gnome Fighter. Getting pretty into it, bought my own d20. </br>
				</br>
				Photography, travel, biking, yoga, snowboarding, and many more are things I like to try to do in my spare time.
