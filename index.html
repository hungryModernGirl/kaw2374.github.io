				I'm Kelly Wilson. I am currently a backend developer for an eCommerce solutions company, Optaros. The work is fast paced and quick to change, so I never have a dull moment. As a female in the tech industry, I'm also very interested in encouraging other women to pursue careers in tech to better the female representation in the field. I participate in Girl Develop It (GDI) classes both as a student and as a teaching assistant. In my other free time, I'm in a band called Ocelot a lot.
